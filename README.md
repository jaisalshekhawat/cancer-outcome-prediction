# 🧬 Cancer Outcome Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project analyzes cancer patient data from the UAE and builds a logistic regression model to predict patient outcomes. It also explores the distribution of cancer types, patient demographics, and treatment timelines.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Dataset: `_cancer_dataset_uae.csv`
- EDA on cancer types and treatment timelines
- Feature engineering (e.g., time between diagnosis and treatment)
- Logistic Regression model for predicting outcomes
- Performance evaluation and visualization

## 🧠 ML Model

- **Logistic Regression** (Scikit-learn)

## 📈 Features Engineered

- `Days_To_Treatment`: Days between diagnosis and treatment
- Encoded categorical features (e.g., Gender, Cancer_Type)

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
